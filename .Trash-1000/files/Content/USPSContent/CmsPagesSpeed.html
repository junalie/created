		<p class="description">[_Studies have shown that speed and response times for a website are very important.]
		</br>[_First of all, the Google page ranking is strongly dependent on response times. Having a fast shop and you are way up in your ranking! ]
		</br>
		</br>[_Response time is also important for the conversion rates. Greg Linden of Amazon said that every 100 milliseconds delay reduces the sales with 1%. So, speeds matters for the conversion rate.]
		</br>
		</br>[_And third, a faster site gives more possibilities for search and filter features giving the users better tools for finding what they are looking for.]
		</br>		
		</br>[_And last, users expect a site to respond quickly. According to a study of Kiss metrics 79% of the customers who are not satisfied about the speed of the site will not return to make another purchase.]
		</br>		
		</br>[_User happiness is important.]

		</br>
		</br>[_Response time plummet with the standard Magento when you have multiple users on the site. Our system does handle multiple users much better.]
